This application was made in collaborations with Isles Financial Services, an organization that helps revitalize and build communities through its financial services and education.

The application contains a few utilities as well as pages and links to learn more about the organization.

It is organized into two tabs, the home screen and the information tab. 

The home tab contains links to the mortgage calculator utility, the budget calculator utility, and the debt calculator utility, as well as to the intake form, the website home page, and the about page.

The mortgage calculator - given a down payment, price of the house, interest rate, term length of the mortgage in years, and monthly HOA fees, the mortgage calculator calculates a monthly payment.

The debt calculator - given a principal, interest rate, and term length in either months or years, the debt calculator calculates a monthly payment.

The budget calculator - given a monthly income and various categories of expenses, the budget calcualtor tells the user whether they are over or under budget, and how much money the expenses go over or under budget.

The about page - displays information about Isles.

The information tab contains a way to press a button to call the organization.

The home page of the application also contains links to the intake form and the home page of the Isles website.

There is a light theme and a dark theme, and the colors of the application change according to the settings on the smartphone's operating system.

The application can be run on iOS (iPhone, iPad) or Android devices. The grid view allows it to adapt to any screen size (within reason). I have tested it on my iPhone and iPad. It would be nice for someone on Android to test it as well, as I only have emulators.

Please let me know what you think about the look and feel of the application and the current utilities. I am more than happy to make any changes before the final version.

I also need to know what information you would like to include on the about and contact pages instead of the placeholder text. I can of course include images, emails, or any other information that can be displayed in a web page as needed.
